hts-demo-en-US-cmudict
======================

This repository contains a copy of the US English
`HTS demo <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/?Download>`_.
The HTS demos are designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the
`HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/>`_ for
statistical parametric speech synthesis.

Please note that this repository is an unofficial copy of the US English HTS
demo and is not endorsed in any way by the HTS working group who maintains the
HTS demos.
Accordingly any questions or bug reports should be directed to the HTS working
group using the contact details given below.

Overview
--------

Starting from a corpus of text data and speech audio data from a human speaker,
this software trains a statistical parametric speech synthesis system designed to
imitate that speaker.
This trained system can then be used to synthesize speech audio for new pieces
of text data.

The text data may be provided in one of two forms:

- as simple text files
- as utterance files generated by
  `Festival <http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>`_
  using the same phoneme set used by the
  `CMU Pronouncing Dictionary <http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict>`_

The speech data should be provided in the form of raw 48 kHz 16-bit audio files,
which are essentially just wav files with the header information removed.

Modifications from the official version
---------------------------------------

This repository contains some minor modifications from the official version of the
US English `HTS demo <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/?Download>`_:

- it does not include a corpus of text data and speech data for training the
  synthesis system.
  The corpus of data used by the official version is based on the
  `CMU ARCTIC corpus for speaker SLT <http://festvox.org/cmu_arctic/dbs_slt.html>`_
  and may obtained by downloading the official version of the
  US English HTS demo from the
  `HTS demo website <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/?Download>`_.
- it adds this README file
- it adds the ``License`` file
- it removes the ``configure`` script since a suitable script can be automatically
  generated from the provided ``configure.ac`` file using ``autoconf``.
  This follows standard version control practices.

Installation
------------

The source code is hosted in the
`hts-demo-en-US-cmudict github repository <https://github.com/MattShannon/hts-demo-en-US-cmudict>`_.
To obtain the latest source code using git::

    git clone git://github.com/MattShannon/hts-demo-en-US-cmudict.git

hts-demo-en-US-cmudict depends on the following software packages:

- `Festival <http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/>`_
  (for the ``dumpfeats`` script)
- `Speech Processing Toolkit (SPTK) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/sp-tk/>`_
- `HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/>`_
- `hts_engine API <http://hts-engine.sourceforge.net/>`_
  (if synthesis using HTS engine rather than HTS's HMGenS tool is desired)

If STRAIGHT vocoding is used (recommended for better quality, though it is not
available under a permissive license) then the following software packages are
also required:

- `STRAIGHT vocoder <http://www.wakayama-u.ac.jp/~kawahara/STRAIGHTadv/index_e.html>`_
- `MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_
  (to run the STRAIGHT vocoder)

The versions of these software packages required can be found in ``INSTALL``.

There are two high-level choices that need to be made when setting-up this
directory:

- whether to provide the text data for the corpus you wish to train on as simple
  text files (in which case the ``configure`` variable USEUTT should be set to 0)
  or as Festival utterance files (in which case USEUTT should be set to 1).
  Using Festival utterance files is the default.
- whether to use the STRAIGHT vocoder (in which case the ``configure`` variable
  USESTRAIGHT should be set to 1) or the non-STRAIGHT vocoder (in which case
  USESTRAIGHT should be set to 0).
  Using the non-STRAIGHT vocoder is the default, but using the STRAIGHT vocoder
  is recommended if possible for better quality.

To set-up this directory:

- add appropriate text files in ``data/txt`` (if USEUTT is 0), Festival utterance
  files in ``data/utts`` (if USEUTT is 1) and raw audio files in ``data/raw`` for
  the corpus you wish to use during training (see above for details of the formats
  used and details of where to obtain the processed CMU ARCTIC corpus typically
  used with this HTS demo)
- generate the ``configure`` script from ``configure.ac`` using ``autoconf``
- follow the instructions for the official version included in ``INSTALL``,
  setting the USEUTT and USESTRAIGHT ``configure`` variables appropriately.
  If you are using a corpus other than the CMU ARCTIC corpus for speaker SLT,
  you may wish to also specify the LOWERF0, UPPERF0, DATASET and SPEAKER
  ``configure`` variables.

submit bugs related to the US English HTS demo, preferably after verifying that
the bug still occurs with the most recent official version available from the
